THEOREM EdgesAxiom == \A Nodes :
                       /\ \A m, n \in Nodes : {m, n} \in Edges(Nodes)
                       /\ \A e \in Edges(Nodes) :
                            \E m, n \in Nodes : e = {m, n}
PROOF OBVIOUS

(* Here's an informal proof of the following theorem                       *)

(* THEOREM For any finite graph G with no self loops and with more than 1  *)
(* node, there exist two nodes with the same degree.                       *)

(* <1>1. It suffices to assume G has at most one node with degree 0.       *)
(*   PROOF The theorem is obviously true if G has two nodes with degree 0. *)
(* <1>2. Let H be the subgraph of G obtained by eliminating all            *)

(*   PROOF By <1>1 and the assumption that G has                           *)
(*       more than one node.                                               *)
(* <1>4. The degree of every node in H is greater than 1 and less than     *)
(*       Cardinality(H).                                                   *)
(*   <2>1. For any node n of H, Degree(n, H) > 0                           *)
