"""Generate Level 2 benchmarks from source .tla files.

Core principle (from src/level2/design.md):
  Keep the model and the statement of the top-level theorem;
  delete all proof content.

For each top-level THEOREM in source/<Module>/<File>.tla we emit one
file benchmark/level2/<Module>/<File>_<TheoremName>.tla in which:
  - The module + EXTENDS + CONSTANT/VARIABLE/ASSUME/AXIOM + all `==`
    definitions are kept verbatim.
  - All other THEOREMs and all LEMMAs (statement + proof) are deleted.
  - The target THEOREM's proof body is replaced with `PROOF OBVIOUS`.
  - INSTANCE-target .tla files are copied alongside with all their
    proofs stripped (`PROOF OMITTED`).

Top-level selection (OR rule, applied to THEOREM-keyword decls only):
  1. Unnamed rule: T has no name (TLA+ syntax can't reference it → standalone).
  2. Shape rule:   statement is `<S> => ...` where `<S>` is a spec formula.
  3. Graph rule:   T has a name and no other theorem references it.

Post-selection filters:
  A. Manual-proof filter: drop candidates whose source has no structured
     TLAPS proof (bare statement / PROOF OMITTED / PROOF OBVIOUS). L2's
     contract is "AI writes a proof, compared against a human reference",
     so candidates without ground truth are out of scope for now.
     Known cost: PaxosTuple.tla:79 `Spec => V!Spec` (proof lives in the
     companion file PaxosProof.tla) and PConProof.tla:520
     `Spec => [](chosen = V!chosen)` (model-checked by TLC, no TLAPS
     proof written). Both are genuine main theorems; they can be revived
     later in a separate "no-reference-proof" track if we ever want it.
  B. Within-file dedup: collapse exact-text-duplicate statements. Catches
     Peterson.tla L124/L134/L183 — three identical
     `THEOREM Spec => []MutualExclusion` decls the author wrote to
     showcase different prover backends; as L2 prompts they are
     indistinguishable, so keep the first by line.
  C. Cross-directory dedup: across all output directories, collapse
     byte-identical target benchmarks. Catches the seven `Sets_*.tla`
     pairs that arise because source/Consensus/Sets.tla and
     source/Data/Sets.tla are near-identical copies of the same
     utility library (only two prover-hint lines differ, both inside
     proof bodies that L2 strips, so the emitted L2 prompts are
     byte-identical). When duplicates are detected, the copy under
     `Data/` is kept (utility libraries are at home in `Data/`); the
     copies in other directories are removed and the audit log records
     each drop. Dep files (e.g. `Sets.tla` itself, copied alongside
     targets) are not subject to this pass — they may legitimately need
     to live in multiple directories because other targets in those
     directories depend on them.

Spec formulas are identified by SANY-AST shape (see src/dataset/sany-dump/),
not by name match. The audit log flags non-`Spec` names, zero specs,
multiple specs, multiple top-level theorems, unnamed top-levels, and
every drop made by filters A, B, and C.
