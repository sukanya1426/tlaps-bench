"""Classify how an agent run terminated — in particular, whether a benchmark
result is trustworthy or was cut short by INFRA_ERROR.

A benchmark verdict (PASS/FAIL) is a capability signal only if the agent
actually got to make a genuine attempt. When the run is cut short by
infrastructure — a corrupted/refused API request, a dropped stream, a server
overload — the resulting FAIL says nothing about the model. We tag such runs
with ``termination_reason = INFRA_ERROR`` so they can be filtered out (and,
later, auto-retried) instead of being read as genuine failures.

Detection is a registry of RULES (criteria). Each rule inspects a
``TerminationContext`` and returns a reason if it fires, else ``None``; the
first rule that fires wins (see :func:`classify`). Today there is exactly one
rule — :func:`codex_turn_failed`. Add more (other backends, which branch on
``ctx.backend`` and read their own event vocabulary; or other patterns) by
appending to :data:`INFRA_RULES`.

This module only CLASSIFIES. Acting on the classification (e.g. auto-retrying
an INFRA_ERROR run) is intentionally left to the caller.
