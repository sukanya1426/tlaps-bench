"""Run tlapm with a wall-clock timeout that kills the whole backend tree.

tlapm spawns backend solvers (z3, cvc4, zenon, isabelle, ...) as separate
processes. A naive timeout would kill only tlapm, orphaning the solvers — they
keep running, steal tens of GB of RAM, and the accumulated tax stalls every
later verification. We defend in two layers: ``start_new_session=True`` puts
tlapm in its own process group and ``killpg`` SIGKILLs every member; that covers
z3/cvc4/zenon. It does NOT catch Isabelle, whose ``bash_process`` wrapper
``setsid``'s into its own session — so we additionally snapshot tlapm's
PPid-chain descendants *before* killing and SIGKILL each one, leaves-first.
