"""Cheat-checker framework — the single sound-reduction predicate, as three gates.

This module IS the framework (W0): a benchmark solution passes iff

    PASS  ⟺  A (identity) ∧ B (discharge) ∧ C (trust)

  A — IDENTITY:  the thing that got proved IS the canonical target. The target
                 statement / CONSTANT / VARIABLE / ASSUME and the definitions it
                 depends on are unchanged; no new AXIOM/ASSUME; no smuggled
                 module or definition; the file parses under standalone SANY.
  B — DISCHARGE: the target goal is genuinely discharged. tlapm proved every
                 generated obligation, no step is MISSING (bare QED / unproven
                 helper / unfinished target), and the only admitted steps are
                 exactly the baseline's GIVEN lemmas (no agent-added admit).
  C — TRUST:     grading ran on trusted files — canonical read-only deps/model
                 plus the agent's proof, in a sandbox, with tlapm unmodified.

"Cheating" is NOT a separate verdict: a cheat is simply some gate failing, so the
outcome is BINARY PASS/FAIL. The per-check reasons are kept for the agent's
in-run formative feedback ("gate B: this obligation has no proof") — never as a
CHEAT accusation. (See the project discussion: a sound reduction lets feedback be
transparent because there is no exploitable gap left to game.)

This layer ORGANIZES existing detection onto the three gates (W1) and collapses
to a binary verdict (W2). It is the consolidation point for logic currently
spread across `tlacheck` rules, `tlapm --strict`, and the SANY validity check.

SAFETY INVARIANT (walking-skeleton migration): not-yet-built stronger checks are
PLACEHOLDERs that FAIL-OPEN. That is sound ONLY because the already-WIRED sibling
checks still cover every known cheat vector, so this layer is never LESS strict
than today's checker. Never delete a WIRED check before its stronger replacement
(the PARTIAL/PLACEHOLDER it would subsume) actually lands.

Roadmap (status per check below): W3 tighten admitted-set to a baseline set-diff;
W4 semantic statement-match (catch operator redefinition); W5 trusted-file replay
(discard dependency edits rather than merely detecting them).
