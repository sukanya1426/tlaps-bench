"""Detect unjustified steps (e.g. bare QED) inside a structured proof.

The SANY top-level proof-node check (admitted_statement) sees a theorem that
HAS a proof but cannot see a bare QED buried inside that proof. tlapm's
``--summary`` does: it reports each theorem with missing proof steps. This rule
consumes that accounting (``ctx.summary``).

Severity is INCOMPLETE, not CHEATING: a bare QED on a trivial closing step (cf.
the borderline IsBijectionTransitive) is an incomplete proof, not necessarily a
deliberate cheat. Policy can elevate it via ``incomplete_is_cheating``.

To avoid double-counting, theorems already flagged as fully admitted (bare /
OMITTED) by ``admitted_statement`` are skipped here — those are CHEATING, and
this rule only adds the "has a real proof but with a hole" case.
