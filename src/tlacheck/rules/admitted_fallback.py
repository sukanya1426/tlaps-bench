"""tlapm-authoritative fallback for the soundness vector (SANY-unparseable cases).

When Java SANY refuses the solution (it is stricter than tlapm — e.g. rejects
bound-variable shadowing tlapm accepts), the static SANY rules cannot run. tlapm
itself parsed the solution (it had to, to verify it), so we fall back to its
``--summary`` accounting: every admitted statement (bare theorem / PROOF OMITTED
/ bare QED) shows up as an "incomplete proof of theorem at line N".

Given (allowed) admitted lemmas — the L1 preamble's preceding OMITTED lemmas —
are subtracted by line: the agent only fills the target's proof and leaves the
preamble intact, so a given lemma keeps its line; a line-set diff against the
baseline summary isolates what the agent introduced.

Agent-created modules are summarized too; any incomplete proof there is a
smuggled axiom (same as the SANY-side smuggled_module rule).

This rule only contributes when ``ctx.sany_ok`` is False — otherwise the precise
SANY rules already cover (and exceed) it.
